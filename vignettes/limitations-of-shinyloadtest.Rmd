`shinyloadtest` is designed to work with a wide variety of application types and deployments, but there are certain types of application and deployment configurations that it is known not to support.

## Deployment limitations

1. **WebSockets are required**: On RStudio Connect and Shiny Server Pro, [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) is used instead of plain WebSockets in order to support browsers and load balancers that don't support WebSockets. Even though Shiny works in the absence of WebSocket support, `shinyloadtest` does not.
1. **shinyapps.io unsupported**: Applications deployed on [http://www.shinyapps.io/](http://www.shinyapps.io/) can't be recorded or load tested.

## Application limitations

1. **Apps must be deterministic**: The recording file made by `record_session` contains messages from the server in the order they were received. If messages are received in a different order by `shinycannon` when it's playing the recording back, that session will be considered a failure. If the same change in inputs does not always lead to outputs being updated in the same order, shinyloadtest will not work.
