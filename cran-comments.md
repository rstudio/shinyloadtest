I have made a fix for the dplyr update and many other cosmetic fixes.

Please let me know if there is any more information I can provide.

Thank you,

Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_shinyloadtest.html>.

Specifically, please see the "no visible binding for global variable"
NOTEs in the "R code for possible problems" check: these are from the
recent upgrade of package dplyr.

Please correct before 2026-02-25 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

Best wishes,
The CRAN Team
