The following changes addressing reviewer feedback were made:

1. The Description field in DESCRIPTION has been expanded.
2. \value was added to all slt_* function documentation
3. Running \examples were added to the slt_plot topic
4. \value was added to load_runs()
5. A \dontrun \example was added to record_session(). \dontrun used because record_session() starts a server.
6. Example datasets suitable for passing to shinyloadtest_report() were added: slt_demo_data_1, slt_demo_data_4, and slt_demo_data_16
7. A running example using a provided example dataset was added to shinyloadtest_report()
