Description: Tools for assessing the number of concurrent users 'shiny' 
  applications are capable of supporting, and for directing application changes
  in order to support a higher number of users. Provides facilities for recording
  'shiny' application sessions, playing recorded sessions against a target 
  server at load, and analyzing the resulting metrics.
